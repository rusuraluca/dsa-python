Problem:
-----------------------------------------------
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/


Iterative Solution:
-----------------------------------------------
@description:
The maximum depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes from the root down to the furthest leaf node.
In other words, it is the height of a binary tree.
Whenever move down to a level, increment height by 1 (height is initialized as 0).
Count number of nodes at each level,
stop traversing when the count of nodes at the next level is 0.
Empty tree = > has a height of 0

- Create a queue
- Push root into the queue
- Keep a var representing the number of nodes in the current level
- Keep a var representing the maximum depth aka height

- While the queue is not empty
    - Number of nodes in the current level = size of queue
    - Otherwise, process each node of the current level and enqueue their non-empty left and right child
    - Increment height by 1 for each level

- If the number of nodes in the queue is 0, it implies that all the levels of the tree have been parsed
  So, return height

@complexity:
Time:   O(n), traverse once the n nodes of the binary tree
Space:  O(n), for the queue data structure
              it will hold at most (1/2)*n nodes <=> n nodes


Recursive Solution:
-----------------------------------------------
@description:
The idea is to traverse the tree in a postorder fashion
and calculate the height of the left and right subtree.
The height of a subtree rooted at any node will be one more
than the maximum height of its left and right subtree.
Recursively apply this property to all tree nodes in a bottom-up manner (postorder fashion)
and return the subtreeâ€™s maximum height rooted at that node.

@complexity:
Time:   O(n), traverse once the n nodes of the binary tree
Space:  O(h), for the call stack
              where h is the height of the tree
