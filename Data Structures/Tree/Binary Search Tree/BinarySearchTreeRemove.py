https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/


Recursive Solution:
-----------------------------------------------
@description:
- Considering it's a BST, we can easily locate the target node to delete
    - If the given key is less than the current node, go to the left subtree;
    - Otherwise, go to the right subtree
- Once we find the target node, we need to reconstruct the current subtree.
  There are generally two cases:
    - There is only one branch or no branch
        - Then we just replace current node with the existed branch or NULL
    - Both left and right branches exist,
        - Then we replace the current node with the node X with the 'closest' value and delete that X
        - We find the closest larger node which is the most left node in the right branch
        - Then delete Z
        - In this time, it will fall in case 1 since X has no left branch

@complexity:
Time:   O(log(n)) <=> O(h), where h is height of binary search tree.
        For height-balanced BSTs, with each comparison, skip about half of the tree
        so that each insertion operation takes time
        proportional to the logarithm of the total number of items n stored in the tree.
        In the worst case, we may have to travel from root to the deepest leaf node.
        In worst case the height is equal to number of nodes
        and the time complexity of search and insert operation may become O(n).

Space:  O(h), used by the recursive routine that is proportional to the treeâ€™s height
