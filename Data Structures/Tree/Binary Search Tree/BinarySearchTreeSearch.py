Problem:
-----------------------------------------------
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/


Recursive Solution:
-----------------------------------------------
@description:
- The algorithm depends on the property of BST that if each left subtree has values below root and each right subtree has values above the root
- Start from the root
    - Compare the searching element with root, if less than root, then recursively call left subtree, else recursively call right subtree
    - If the element to search is found anywhere, return true, else return false

@complexity:
Time:   O(log(n)) <=> O(h), where h is height of binary search tree.
        For height-balanced BSTs, with each comparison, skip about half of the tree
        so that each insertion operation takes time
        proportional to the logarithm of the total number of items n stored in the tree.
        In the worst case, we may have to travel from root to the deepest leaf node.
        In worst case the height is equal to number of nodes
        and the time complexity of search and insert operation may become O(n).

Space: O(h), used by the recursive routine that is proportional to the treeâ€™s height
