Problem:
-----------------------------------------------
https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/


Sorting Solution:
-----------------------------------------------
@description:
The idea here is to first traverse an array and create a map of all numbers and their count.
The ideal data structure for storing key and value pairs is HashMap.
Sort the HashMap by its value and pick only k elements.

@complexity:
Time:  O(nlogn), for sorting the n elements
Space: O(n), for the hashmap


Priority Queue (Min Heap) Solution:
-----------------------------------------------
@description:
Let’s improve our previous solution using a priority queue.
To solve this problem first create a map of each element and its count.
Then use a priority queue (Min Heap) and we keep its size equal to k.
Take all the keys of a map and put them in a Priority Queue.
If the size of a priority queue is greater than k,
we poll the top element which is the minimum element.
Once all the elements of HashMap are put in a Priority queue, we only get the top k elements.

@complexity:
Time:  O(nlogk)
Space: O(n), for the min heap
