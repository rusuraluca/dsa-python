## `Interview BEST Practices`
### `CHECKLIST`
    1. Read back the question to your interviewer(s) so you all are on the same page.
    2. Clarify the situation, and you doubts and whether you should assume anything
    3. Things might have already started hitting your brain - so instead of uttering something not useful, think for a moment and form your explanation for the solution.
    4. Take them through your solution - each and everything - what data structure you are using and why? what is time and space complexity? Could you do better? 
    5. Incorporate interviewer's feedback in your approach.
    6. After they are satisfied with your solution start coding.

### `BEWARE`
- #### Always code optimally!
    Don't waste their time and especially your time on brute force solutions (Just brief them about it - 30 secs)

- #### Take fewer hints
    Take zero if possible and only when if absolutely necessary (dead end situation)

- #### Write neat and tidy code
    Always think you have to get it merged in the production and people are ready to reject your PR.
    
    Proper variable & function naming - absolutely avoid  `s`, `a`, `A` or functions like `solve`, `go`) 
    
    Use the code space properly - cleaner `if`, `for`, `while` and `function` blocks.

- #### Own your thoughts
    If you have a solution in mind, you should be able to sing it like a song. Explain you thinking process (this is what they are interested in). 
    
    Take a moment, build the explanation in your head and tell them step by step - data structures involved, algorithm paradigm, time complexity and space complexity etc.
